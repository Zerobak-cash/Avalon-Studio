CompletionList/CompletionListBox notes:
- If you see errors about multiple base classes (Popup and StyledElement), replace inheritance to derive from Popup only,
  and move any StyledElement-specific code to a contained control or to the Popup's Child.
- Example pattern:
    public class CompletionWindowBase : Popup { /* child is a Control that holds items */ }
- Ensure using Avalonia.Controls.Templates; is present where ControlTemplate is referenced.
